					Shadow Profile: Artistkent, Matrix Artisan <br>

Runner Handle: Artistkent<br>

Specialization: Matrix Artisan (Web Developer)<br><br>

Overview:<br>
In the sprawling digital wilderness of the Matrix, I'm your go-to artisan. My game? Weaving code and crafting virtual spaces that aren't just functional - they're a slice of the future. I blend the logic of a decker with the vision of a street artist, making me a rare breed in the shadowrunning circuits of web development.<br><br>

Technical Arsenal:<br>

Languages: Slinging HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP like a true cyber wizard.
Frameworks & Libraries: Mastering the digital spells of React, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js.
Database Manipulation: Commanding both SQL and NoSQL realms, including MySQL and MongoDB.
Tools & Platforms: Adept in the shadow arts of Git and various Matrix hosting platforms.
Responsive Constructs: Specializing in crafting virtual landscapes that shift and adapt across any device or screen in the Matrix.<br><br>

Runs & Exploits:<br>
Navigated the neon-lit mazes of small biz sites to the complex architectures of mega-corp e-commerce platforms. My digital graffiti is all over the Matrix, working with start-ups, corp entities, and lone wolves, leaving a trail of exceeded expectations.<br><br>

Edge:<br>

Problem-Solving: I crack digital puzzles and fix glitches, ensuring my creations are as tough as they are sleek.<br>
User Interface Alchemy: Got an eagle eye for design and a hacker's instinct for usability, building seamless experiences for any user braving the Matrix.<br>
Crew Synergy: Whether I'm running point or riding shotgun, I'm your man for clear comms and tight teamwork in the digital shadows.<br><br>
Matrix Education:<br>
Earned my stripes with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, with further education in Computer Science, specialized in the arcane arts of web craft and design.<br><br>

Persona Traits:<br>
Driven by a mix of creative fire and razor-sharp focus. Always jacked into the latest trends in the Matrix, I blend tech savvy with a street-smart aesthetic for websites that are as functional as they are revolutionary.<br><br>

Ambitions in the Shadows:<br>
Aiming to level up in the latest Matrix tech and take on runs that leave a mark. Got a keen interest in making the digital world accessible to all, building virtual spaces where every user, no matter their code, can thrive.

							We're talking about a website, but not just any old data slab in the 'trix. This one's a virtual tailor, a cyber clothier if you will. It lets you design a 3D shirt, right there in the Matrix. Think custom threads, your style, your call, all in three-dimensional glory. Perfect for making a statement in the shadows or just stepping up your fashion game. Whether you're a runner needing to look sharp for a meet or just wanting to stand out from the crowd, this site's the key to decking out in some unique gear.

						</a>
						<p class="project_numero_text">
							We got ourselves an Article Summarizer here, juiced up with OpenAI's ChatGPT tech. This bad boy slices through websites, boiling down their drek to the core info you need. No more sifting through pages of data, this tool does the legwork, giving you the gist, clean and quick. Perfect for a runner on the move in the shadows of the 'trix.

						<p class="project_numero_text">
							What we've got here is a decked-out portfolio site, crafted for a Freelance Geologist. This ain't your average Joe's data haven. It's a specialized zone where this rockhound showcases their skills, digs, and geological wizardry. Ideal for a lone wolf playing the corp game or dealing with anyone needing an expert in the Earth's secrets. Whether they're scanning for rare minerals or mapping the Barrens, this site's their digital calling card in the sprawl.

						<p class="project_numero_title">REAL ESTATE WEBSITE</p>
						
						
						</a>
						<p class="project_numero_text">
							What we're looking at here is a Real Estate Website, still getting its cyber-legs under it for a client. This isn't some run-of-the-mill slot in the Matrix; it's a custom job, a digital turf being sculpted to showcase properties, habitats, maybe even some high-end corp condos or shadowy safehouses. Right now, it's in the skeleton phase, wiring up for the big launch. Once it's live, it'll be the go-to grid for anyone looking to buy, sell, or squat in prime real estate, from the glittering tops of corp skyscrapers to the depths of the urban jungle. Keep an eye on this one; it's going to be big in the sprawl.
